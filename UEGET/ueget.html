 Ultlang Epic Gamer Encoding Thing : Version 0.4β

 UEGET TABLES:
 The tables have been moved into a <a href="tables.html">separate file</a>.

 BLOCKS:
     PAGE 00 (Central Europe):
     %00 ~ %0f (00-HXN) : Hexadecimal Numbers,
     %10       (00-CCM) : Control Code Representation Marker,
     %11 ~ %1f (00-MTH) : Mathematics,
     %20 ~ %3f (00-PNC) : Punctuation,
     %40 ~ %49 (00-ARR) : Arrows,
     %4a ~ %4f (00-SHP) : Shapes,
     %50 ~ %7f (00-LLC) : Lowercase Basic Latin, Czech and Slovak,
     %80 ~ %b1 (00-ULC) : Uppercase Basic Latin, Czech and Slovak,
     %b2 ~ %bd (00-AST) : Astronomical Symbols,
     %be       (00-SUS) : Sussy,
     %bf       (00-API) : Apioform,
     %c0 ~ %d6 (00-SBD) : Shading and Box Drawing,
     %d7 ~ %ef (00-PLL) : Polish and Lithuanian,
     %fa ~ %ff (00-CCD) : Control Codes.

     PAGE 01 (???):
     %00 ~ %0f (01-HXN) : Hexadecimal Numbers,
     %10       (01-CCM) : Control Code Representation Marker,
     %11 ~ %1f (01-MTH) : Mathematics,
     %20 ~ %3f (01-PNC) : Punctuation,
     %b0 ~ %bb (01-ZDC) : Zodiac Symbols,
     %bc ~ %bf (01-CRS) : Card Suits,
     %fa ~ %ff (01-CCD) : Control Codes.
  
 The codepoints %f0 to %f9<00, %40 to %af<01 and %c0 to %f9<01,
 as well as all pages other than 00 and 01, are currently unused.
 
 NOTES:
 Cells with the value "AL" are allocated to a block, but yet not to a value.
 The codepoints %0a ~ %0f<00 should only be used in hexadecimal number
 contexts, otherwise Latin block letters are preferred.
 Similarly, %12 is only to be used for the constant e, the regular e letter
 must be represented with %52<00 or an equivalent value.
 %5e<00, %5f<00, %8e<00, %8f<00, %b0<00 and %b1<00 should occupy two
 characters' worth of space.
 
 CHARACTERS REPRESENTED IN THE TABLES WITH AN @ MARKER (non-monospace
 / non-unicode):
 @ap (%be<00) :
     A bee. In many monospace fonts, the bee emoji does not fit into
     the monospace grid. Therefore, I have represented it as ¤b
     in the table, even though it is not related to the rest of the
     ¤ representation codepoints.
 @su (%bf<00) :
     An Among Us impostor / crewmate. The closest Unicode approximation
     is probably U+0d9e (Sinhala Letter Kantaja Naasikyaya).
 @░▀, ;▒▀, @▓▀, @░▄, @▒▄ and @▓▄ (%c4 ~ %c6<00; %c8 ~ %ca<00) :
     The characters in these ranges have no Unicode equivalent to my
     knowledge; they should look like shaded variants of ▀ and ▄.
 
 CONTROL CODES:
 ¤n (%ff) : A newline.
 ¤t (%fe) : A tab character.
 ¤e (%fd) : Start of an "Escapoid" (see "ESCAPOIDS" for more information).
 ¤d (%fc) : A "ding": emits a sound.
 ¤p (%fb) : Switches the current codepage.
 ¤c (%fa) : Clears the entire screen.
 
 PAGE SWITCHING:
 The default page is assumed to be 00 until a page switch sequence occurs.
 To switch the page, the ¤p (%fb) control code is used in conjunction with
 two hexadecimal digits (HXN block): %bd %fb %00 %01 %bd prints a comet
 symbol followed by a heart.
 
 ESCAPOIDS:
     COLOUR ESCAPOID:
     The default colour is assumed to be white at the start of a file.
     The COLOUR escapoid uses this representation of colours:
         0 (%00) : white
         1 (%01) : black
         2 (%02) : red
         3 (%03) : orange
         4 (%04) : yellow
         5 (%05) : green
         6 (%06) : cyan
         7 (%07) : blue
         8 (%08) : purple
         9 (%09) : pink
         a (%0a) : magenta
         b (%0b) : light green
         c (%0c) : light purple
         d (%0d) : gray
         e (%0e) : light gray
         f (%0f) : custom colour.
         (todo recommended hex codes for these)
     The "custom colour" character must then be followed by six more
     hex digits (from the Hexadecimal Numbers block) representing a 24-bit
     RGB colour, like in this example:
         0f 0c 0c 09 09 0f 0f
            R1 R2 G1 G2 B1 B2,
     where ff represents full intensity of the light and 00 means it being
     turned off completely (therefore fcc99ff is a lavender colour).
     
     The format of a COLOUR escapoid is ¤ec (%fd 0c) followed by the
     colour representation. Therefore, the following should print a white
     "w", a pink "p" and a lime green "l":
         %51 fd 72 09 59 fd 0c 0f 04 03 0f 0f 00 00 68

     BACKGROUND ESCAPOID:
     The BACKGROUND escapoid works in a similar way to the COLOUR one, except
     the colour representation is slightly different and the format is ¤eb
     (%fd 0b). Its default value is black.
     The colour representation codes are these:
         0 (%00) : black
         1 (%01) : white
         2 (%02) : dark red
         3 (%03) : orange
         4 (%04) : brown
         5 (%05) : dark green
         6 (%06) : dark cyan
         7 (%07) : dark blue
         8 (%08) : dark purple
         9 (%09) : dark pink
         a (%0a) : red
         b (%0b) : green
         c (%0c) : purple
         d (%0d) : dark gray
         e (%0e) : gray
         f (%0f) : custom colour.
         (todo hex codes for these as well, possibly change palette)
